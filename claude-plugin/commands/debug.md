description: Trial-run a replication package (on a COPY) as a smoke test — confirm the code runs without errors and that the injected Table/Figure output commands actually produced files. On a runtime error it does NOT auto-fix; it explains the root cause, offers a few fix options, and asks the author to choose (AskUserQuestion), then applies the chosen fix and re-runs. It executes code but never compares coefficients and never issues a reproducibility verdict. Use after /reproai-fix to verify the fixed copy actually runs and emits its tables and figures.

# /reproai debug — smoke-test the package, author decides every fix

This is the one reproai command that **runs the author's code**. Its purpose is narrow and explicit:
a **smoke test** — confirm (a) the package runs end-to-end without errors, and (b) the output
commands (especially the ones `/reproai-fix` injected for D1) actually wrote their tables and figures
to `output/tables` / `output/figures`. Then surface every generated table and figure for the author's
eyeball test against the paper.

**What this command does NOT do** (still true, and important):
- It does **not** compare coefficients to the paper.
- It does **not** issue any "reproducible / verified / certified" verdict — that is Line 2.
- It does **not** auto-fix errors in a silent loop. **Every fix is the author's decision.**

## Boundary

- Always operate on a **copy** (`<root>_fixed`, the output of `/reproai-fix`, or a fresh copy you
  make). The author's original package is never run-modified.
- You execute code, but you only read two things off the run: **did it error**, and **did the
  expected output files appear**. Nothing numerical is judged.

## Steps

1. **Pick the target copy.** Prefer the `<root>_fixed` produced by `/reproai-fix`. If none exists,
   make one: `cp -r <ROOT> <ROOT>_debug`. Never run the original in place.

2. **Determine the run order.** Use the master script if present; else the README's documented order;
   else ask the author for the order (this is exactly the `A11-explicit-run-order` finding). Do not
   guess an order for a multi-script package.

3. **Trial-run, one script at a time**, capturing stdout/stderr to a log:
   - Stata: `stata -b do <script>.do` (or `stata-mp`/`StataSE` as available), then read `<script>.log`
     for `r(###)` errors.
   - R: `Rscript <script>.R 2>&1 | tee <script>.log`.
   - Python: `python3 <script>.py 2>&1 | tee <script>.log`.
   Stop at the first script that errors.

4. **On a runtime error — STOP and consult the author. Do NOT auto-fix.**
   a. Read the log; locate the failing command and the error code/message.
   b. Determine the **root cause** in one or two sentences (missing package, undefined variable,
      missing intermediate file, path issue, version-specific syntax, etc.).
   c. Compose **2–4 concrete fix options**, each with its trade-off / risk.
   d. Call **`AskUserQuestion`** with a `questions` entry:
      - `header`: short label, e.g. "ivreg2 not found"
      - `question`: the root cause + what you propose
      - `options`: each `{label, description}` = one fix option (the host adds an "Other" free-text
        choice automatically)
   e. **Wait for the author's choice.** Apply ONLY the chosen option, to the copy. If the author
      picks "Other", follow their instruction.
   f. Re-run from the failing script. Repeat from step 4 if it errors again.

5. **When the package runs clean**, verify the injected outputs fired:
   - Confirm files exist under `output/tables/` and `output/figures/` (the D1 targets).
   - If an expected output is missing, that is itself a finding → go to step 4 (root cause: the
     output command didn't fire / wrote elsewhere) and ask the author.

6. **Hand the author the smoke-test result:**
   - which scripts ran clean,
   - the list of generated tables (paths under `output/tables/`) and figures (`output/figures/`),
   - any fixes applied (and which option the author chose for each),
   - an explicit note: "This is a smoke test — the code runs and emits its artifacts. It is NOT a
     reproducibility verdict; eyeball the tables/figures against the paper, or send the package to
     Line 2 for numerical certification."

## Hard rules

- Run only the copy; never run-modify the original.
- Never auto-fix a runtime error — always present root cause + options via `AskUserQuestion` and let
  the author choose.
- Never compare a produced number to the paper; never say the package "reproduces".
- If the runtime (Stata/R/Python) is not installed, say so and stop — do not fake a run.
- Respect the run order; for a multi-script package with no documented order, ask, don't guess.
