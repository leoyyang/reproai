# /reproai update — knowledge version & update

reproai ships a **knowledge base** (author rule set + venue profiles + style guide) that grows as the
downstream reproducibility pipeline (Line 2) learns from new replication packages. The rules are
data, not code, so they update independently of how a single package is diagnosed.

## Show what's installed

Run a check and read the `knowledge_versions` block of the result, or:

```bash
reproai check . --json | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['knowledge_versions'])"
```

It reports `engine` (code version), `rules_version` (date-based, e.g. 2026.06.15), and each venue
profile version. The `reproai check` summary line also prints `knowledge: engine X, rules Y`.

## Update to the latest

reproai has **two parts**: the plugin *commands* (shipped through the Marketplace) and the Python
*engine* that holds the rules and venue profiles (installed from this repo). The rules live in the
engine, so updating the plugin alone does **not** refresh them — update both.

First, the commands:

```
/plugin marketplace update reproai        # refresh the marketplace listing
/plugin update reproai                      # latest commands
/reload-plugins                             # (or restart) so the new commands load
```

Then the engine, where the rules and venue profiles actually live:

```bash
pip install -U "git+https://github.com/leoyyang/reproai#subdirectory=core"
```

Re-run a check and read `knowledge_versions` to confirm the new `rules_version` loaded.

## How new rules get in (for maintainers)

Two sources feed the front of this pipeline: internal Line 2 telemetry, and **user contributions filed
via `/reproai:contribute`** (GitHub issues). Venue suggestions arrive the same way and merge as a new
`venues/<id>.yaml` after maintainer review.

```
Line 2 lessons  ──tools/distill_rules.py──▶  rules-seedbank/candidates.json  ──human review──▶
tools/promote_rule.py  ──▶  author_rules.yaml (rules_version bumped, CHANGELOG updated)  ──▶
tools/bump_version.py  ──▶  plugin/marketplace/pyproject versions in lockstep  ──▶  publish
```

Nothing enters the shipped rule set without human review (anti-noise principle). See
`rules-seedbank/README.md`.
