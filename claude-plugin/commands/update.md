# /reproai update — knowledge version & update

reproai ships a **knowledge base** (author rule set + venue profiles + style guide) that grows as the
downstream reproducibility pipeline (Line 2) learns from new replication packages. The rules are
data, not code, so they update independently of how a single package is diagnosed.

## Show what's installed

Run a check and read the `knowledge_versions` block of the result, or:

```bash
reproai check . --json | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['knowledge_versions'])"
```

It reports `engine` (code version), `rules_version` (date-based, e.g. 2026.06.15), and each venue
profile version. The `reproai check` summary line also prints `knowledge: engine X, rules Y`.

## Update to the latest

reproai is distributed through the Plugin Marketplace; a new rules_version ships as a new plugin
version. To update:

```
/plugin marketplace update reproai        # refresh the marketplace listing
/plugin update reproai                      # install the latest reproai (new rules included)
```

Then `/reload-plugins` (or restart) so the new rules load.

## How new rules get in (for maintainers)

Two sources feed the front of this pipeline: internal Line 2 telemetry, and **user contributions filed
via `/reproai:contribute`** (GitHub issues). Venue suggestions arrive the same way and merge as a new
`venues/<id>.yaml` after maintainer review.

```

Nothing enters the shipped rule set without human review (anti-noise principle). See
`rules-seedbank/README.md`.
