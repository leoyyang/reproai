/*
 * content.js — the single source of truth for ALL copy on the ReproAI landing page.
 *
 * HOW TO EDIT
 *   Change any string below and save. `npm run dev` hot-reloads instantly; `npm run build`
 *   ships it. App.jsx only handles layout + animation — it reads every word of visible text
 *   from this file, so editing here is all you need. No sync step, nothing can drift.
 *
 * SYNTAX-HIGHLIGHTED BLOCKS are token lists rather than plain sentences:
 *   - install.claude.lines / install.codex.lines  → the two install terminals
 *   - usage.cli.runLines                           → the command-line terminal demo
 *   - cite.bibLines                                → the BibTeX block
 *   To edit them, change the text inside each token's  t: "..."  . The wrapper
 *   (P, CMD, SLASH, FLAG, OUT, TXT / AT, KEY, FLD, VAL, PUN) only sets the highlight color.
 *   The "Copy" button copies text derived from bibLines automatically — nothing to keep in sync.
 *
 * INLINE CODE: in plain prose, wrap a word in `backticks` to render it as <code> (monospace).
 *
 * NOT HERE: the browser tab title and the search/social-preview description live in
 *   site/index.html (they must be static HTML so crawlers and link unfurlers can read them).
 *   Those two strings are the only page copy outside this file.

ReproAI diagnoses common package issues and rewrites a copy for clarity and consistency. Optional smoke tests or full tests then check whether the revised package actually runs. The scientific judgment behind the findings remains the authors' own.",

        a: "Only when you ask it to. The three core commands — `check`, `comply`, and `fix` — are static: they inspect your files, structure, and dependencies but never execute your analysis. The `debug` command runs your code, but only as a smoke test (see below).",
      },
      {
        q: "What does the debug command do?",
        a: "It trial-runs a copy of your package as a smoke test: does the package execute end to end, and are the table and figure outputs actually written? If a runtime error occurs, it explains the root cause to you, offers a few options, and asks you to choose. It only runs the copy, never your original.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which venues does it support?",
        a: "It ships profiles for AEA (AER, AEJ, JEL, JEP), the Econometric Society (Econometrica, QE, TE), JASA (Journal of the American Statistical Association), APSR, AJPS, and JOP, plus generic Dataverse and openICPSR fallbacks. Profiles are data files, so the list grows over time.",
      },
      {
        q: "What does P0–P4 mean?",
        a: "Findings are graded by downstream reproducibility cost. P0 blocks reproduction. P1 imposes a large cost, often requiring many fix-loop rounds. P2 creates a moderate risk of misreading. P3 covers minor organization issues. P4 covers venue-specific polish. You can choose to fix only P0 issues, P0 and P1 issues, or all findings.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will fixing everything guarantee a first-try pass?",
        a: "No, and ReproAI says so. The plugin increases the chance of a first-try pass by removing known, avoidable failures before a data editor runs the package. Numerical match, full environment reconstruction, and runtime behavior only surface at execution, so a guarantee would not be honest.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it auto-fix my files?",
        a: "Only for the small set of fixes that are clearly semantics-preserving, and only on a copy. ReproAI never changes your original files, and dry-run is the default. Anything that could change a result is propose-only and left for you to apply.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which tools does it work with?",
