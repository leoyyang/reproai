# reproai update — knowledge version & update (Codex)

reproai ships a knowledge base (author rule set + venue profiles + style guide) that grows over
time. The rules are data, not code.

## Show what's installed

```bash
reproai check . --json | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['knowledge_versions'])"
```

It reports `engine` (code version), `rules_version` (date-based), and each venue profile version.
The `reproai check` summary line also prints `knowledge: engine X, rules Y`.

## Update to the latest

reproai is distributed through the Codex plugin marketplace; a new rules_version ships as a new
plugin version:

```
codex plugin marketplace update reproai
codex plugin update reproai
```

Then restart Codex (or reload) so the new rules load.

## How new rules get in (for maintainers)

```
Line 2 lessons → tools/distill_rules.py → rules-seedbank/candidates.json → human review →
tools/promote_rule.py → author_rules.yaml (rules_version bumped) →
tools/bump_version.py → versions in lockstep → publish
```

Nothing enters the shipped rule set without human review. See `rules-seedbank/README.md`.
